# LSE-IP-Fleeing-DV-London
In this independent project (dissertation for LSE's MSC City Design and Social Science, 2022), I sought to explore the influence of space and societal factors on temporary accommodations (TAs), housing policy, and housing austerity, particularly as they impact options for women and children fleeing domestic violence.

## Introduction/Context: ##

- Advocacy for housing rights: Advocating for survivors' access to proper temporary accommodations and tenancy security in London by linking domestic violence issues with feminist housing needs.
- Overlooked forced migration: Highlighted the lack of recognition regarding forced migration caused by domestic violence in the UK due to limited quantitative research on gender-filtered internal migration.
- Exploration of space and societal impact: Investigated how space, society, TAs, housing policy, and austerity shape choices for women and children in abusive situations.

## Objectives: ## 

- Impact on fighting domestic violence: To explore how refuges and social services provision could alter approaches to combat domestic violence.
- Collaboration for homelessness resolution: To examine strategies for public and private sector cooperation to effectively address and potentially end homelessness.

## Data Collection and Analysis: ##

- Extensive academic literature and qualitative research based on interviews with support workers aiding survivors of DV. (Please see the references part of the dissertation for more information)
- Utilized open housing data from GLA 2022 and MHCLG 2019, including rent, domestic abuse offences, and indices of multiple deprivation. (Please see the references part of the dissertation for more information)
- Employed spatial analysis via QGIS to understand correlations between deprivation, crime, DV, and housing costs.

## Key Learnings/Insights: ##

- Proven role of organizations in safeguarding human rights.
- Highlighted adverse effects of housing regulations and local authority enforcement on homelessness and access to services.
- Outlined challenges faced by vulnerable groups, especially women fleeing violence, due to service cuts and restricted city rights.

## Challenges and Solutions: ##

- Main challenge: Addressing multifaceted issues related to DV, safety, housing, and citizenship.
- Employed diagrams to simplify complex concepts derived from extensive references and interviews.

- Future focus on collaborations, deeper analysis, and publication for a broader impact.

## Future Steps/Recommendations: ##

- Advocated for a unique transport fare in London to aid financially affected women and families relocated away from work opportunities.
- Urged enhanced quantitative and qualitative data collection on DV survivors for policy advocacy and improved understanding of housing dynamics.
- Proposed collaboration between public and private sectors to regulate affordable housing and protect families from displacement.
- Emphasized feminist and intersectional approaches in planning, governance, and design to prevent gender-based violence.
- Called for improved services by local authorities and institutions to combat DV, resist housing austerity, and address systemic injustices.
